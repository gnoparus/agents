/**
 * Run-level configuration controlling HITL semantics. **HITL is OFF by
 * default** for now — the SDK ships the interrupt machinery, but the
 * default stays opt-in until host UIs (notably LibreChat) ship the
 * approval-rendering affordances needed to surface interrupts to end
 * users. Without that UI, an interrupt with no resolver looks like a
 * hung tool-call card. Hosts opt in explicitly with
 * `{ enabled: true }`. The intent is to flip this default to ON in a
 * future minor once the consumer ecosystem is ready to render
 * interrupts end-to-end.
 *
 * When enabled (`{ enabled: true }`):
 *
 *   - `PreToolUse` hooks returning `decision: 'ask'` raise a real
 *     LangGraph `interrupt()` instead of being treated as a synchronous
 *     deny.
 *   - `Run.create` installs a `MemorySaver` checkpointer fallback on the
 *     run's compile options if the host did not provide one, since
 *     LangGraph requires a checkpointer to suspend and resume.
 *
 * When disabled (the default — omitted, or `{ enabled: false }`):
 * `ask` decisions are fail-closed (blocked with an error
 * `ToolMessage`) and no checkpointer is implicitly attached. This
 * matches the pre-HITL behavior so existing hosts upgrading the SDK
 * see no change until they're ready to wire the resume UI.
 *
 * ## Scope: event-driven tools only
 *
 * The interrupt path is wired into `ToolNode.dispatchToolEvents`, which
 * runs when the agent uses event-driven tool dispatch (the path
 * LibreChat and most production hosts take). Tools that execute via
 * the direct path — i.e. tools listed in `directToolNames` (the
 * graph-managed handoff and subagent tools) or tools on agents
 * configured WITHOUT `eventDrivenMode` — bypass the hook system
 * entirely. `PreToolUse` hooks do not fire for those tools and HITL
 * approval does not gate them.
 *
 * Practical implications:
 *   - LibreChat-style hosts using event-driven dispatch get the full
 *     HITL surface across every tool the model calls.
 *   - Hosts using `AgentInputs.tools` directly without event-driven
 *     mode get policy enforcement for nothing — the hooks register
 *     but never fire. Either switch to event-driven mode or accept
 *     that direct tools are not approval-gated. This is documented
 *     also on `ToolNodeOptions.hookRegistry`.
 *   - Mixed direct + event batches (e.g. a handoff tool sharing an
 *     LLM turn with a regular tool) currently re-execute the direct
 *     half on resume, since LangGraph rolls back the entire ToolNode
 *     on `interrupt()` throw. Hosts whose direct tools have side
 *     effects (subagents that invoke models, handoffs that trigger
 *     downstream work) should avoid mixing those tools into the same
 *     batch as approval-gated event tools.
 *
 * ## Note on idempotency
 *
 * When an interrupt fires, LangGraph re-runs the interrupted node
 * from the start on resume, which fires `PreToolUse` hooks again.
 * Hooks that produce side effects (logging, external calls) will see
 * two invocations per paused turn.
