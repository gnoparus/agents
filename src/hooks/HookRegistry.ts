 * ## Why `Map<sessionId, MatcherBucket>` and not `Record`
 *
 * LibreChat runs thousands of parallel sessions in one Node process, and
 * hook registration happens inside hot paths (tool loading, agent spawning).
 * A `Record<sessionId, ...>` has to be spread on every insertion, which is
 * O(n) per call and O(n²) total for a batch of parallel registrations. A
 * Map mutates in place, keeping insertions O(1). This mirrors the reasoning
 * Claude Code documents at `utils/hooks/sessionHooks.ts:62`.
